# Code Quiz

Code Quiz uses jQuery to dynamically generate questions & answers as you progress through the timed quiz, deducting 10 seconds of time for each wrong answer. Once the quiz is finished, the score/time remaining is marked and the player's initials can be entered to save the score to the High Score board. High scores are saved in localStorage and are persistent through different playthroughs.
